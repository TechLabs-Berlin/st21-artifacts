# Documentation

## What did Steffi do?

- Set up initial folder structure for usage with React and Firebase
- initial documents are set up and linked:
  - **index.html** and _bundle.js_ under _public_
  - src-folder for React with **app.js**
  - _AppRouter.js_ and initial pages and first _components_ for client side routing via **React-Router**
  - config file _firebase.js_ for **Firebase**
  - a few **dev tools** like _webpack_, _webpack dev server_ and _babel_ (see _package.json_)
  - there are first outcommended lines of code for handling our data to Firebase database for notice

## What shall I do initially to be set up for Web Dev?

Git Bash on a new folder:

- clone the repo to your local machine: **git clone https://github.com/TechLabs-Berlin/st21-artifacts.git**

Git Bash on Artifacts-folder:

- pull all the data: **git pull**

Git Bash on WD-folder:

- set up the missing information from .gitignore
  - installation of all packages (node_module): **yarn install**
  - key.js -> ask Steffi for database information and store the document in the WD-folder

## What shall I do regulary to be set up for Web Dev?

Git Bash on Artifacts-folder:

- pull the latest data: **git pull**

Git Bash on WD-folder:

- run Git Bash on folder **WD** with: **yarn run dev-server**
- open Chrome or Firefox and visit **localhost:8080**
- open **WD** in your _VS Code_
- have fun ^^

## Where could I get help?

- ask Steffi for a introduction to initial structure for discussion
- all the things are part of the React course: **chapters 6, 7, 9 and 14**
