# Initial Push by Steffi 24.05.21

## What did Steffi do?

- Set up initial folder structure for usage with React and Firebase
- initial documents are set up and linked:
  - **index.html** and _bundle.js_ under _public_
  - src-folder for React with **app.js**
  - _AppRouter.js_ and initial pages and first _components_ for client side routing via **React-Router**
  - config file _firebase.js_ for **Firebase**
  - a few **dev tools** like _webpack_, _webpack dev server_ and _babel_ (see _package.json_)
  - there are first outcommended lines of code for handling our data to Firebase database for notice

## What shall I do initially to be set up for Web Dev?

- clone the repo to your local machine
- pull all the data
- set up the missing information from [.gitignore] (https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lGXaB7k=/)
  - node_module -> installation "yarn install"
  - key.js -> ask Steffi for database information

## What shall I do regulary to be set up for Web Dev?

- pull the latest data
- run Git Bash on folder **WD** with **yarn run dev-server**
- open Chrome or Firefox and visit **localhost:8080**
- open **WD** in your _VS Code_
- have fun ^^

## Where could I get help?

- ask Steffi for a introduction to initial structure for discussion
- all the things are part of the React course: **chapters 6, 7, 9 and 14**
