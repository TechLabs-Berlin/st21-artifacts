# Artifacts

## Overview
**Artifacts** - born from an idea to provide the Berlin artist scene with a web app to make borrowing artists equipment easy and accessible using its own currency, the product concept has quickly developed into a platform for buying and selling second-hand artist supplies thanks to critical user research and survey. Artifacts allows users to post, search, find and manage items, called Artifacts, and contact the current owners.

In addition to functionalities such as user login via an existing Googlemail account, an search mask for finding artifacts and an editable user profile, Artifacts also allows users to create and delete their own items and save favorites. With the connection to a Google Firebase Realtime Database, the information is stored securely and can be retrieved at a later session.

This repo is part of the Tech Labs Berlin summer 2021 Project Phase.
